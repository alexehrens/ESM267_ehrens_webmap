# Surface Water Availability for Agricultural Water Users in Sacramento Valley

Groundwater basins in the Sacramento Valley are currently in the process of preparing management plans to meet the January 2022 deadline mandated by the [Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA)](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Groundwater-Management/SGMA-Groundwater-Management). Throughout this process, basin managers must make important decisions on which approaches should be taken to achieve sustainable groundwater use and avoid the undesirable results of overdraft.

A significant approach for ending overdraft is demand management, which requires groundwater users to cut back on pumping. For agricultural users, less groundwater supply means fewer acres that can be irrigated – unless they have access to surface water. Surface water is a valuable asset as a substitutable supply to cope with groundwater reductions. Understanding where users with surface water – and those without – are located is important for understanding which agricultural lands are vulnerable to being taken permanently out of production to meet SGMA demand goals.

To address this question, I (during a summer internship at PPIC) compiled a dataset on surface water availability for agricultural lands across the Sacramento Valley, similar to previous work done in the [San Joaquin Valley](https://www.ppic.org/blog/water-availability-for-san-joaquin-valley-farms-a-balancing-act/). These datasets together provide information on the landscape of surface water availability for the entire Central Valley. 

The map below shows surface water availability per acre of irrigated agriculture for each water user in the Sacramento Valley, using average water deliveries from 2009-19 and cropland mapping from 2016. Lands in red, orange, or yellow are those that fall beneath 3 acre-feet per acre of surface water. Generally, lands with less than 3 acre-feet per acre need to supplement with groundwater to meet their crop growth needs.
